| **Stage**                     | **Weightage** | **Meets Expectations**                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Reading/Data Understanding** | 5            | The learner has imported the .json data and created the dataframe from it. The learner also has to read the data and make the initial analysis out of it.                  |
| **Data Cleaning**             | 10           | The learner has to do the data cleaning operations like filtering text, removing missing values & renaming column headers.                                                  |
| **Data Preprocessing**        | 10           | Data pre-processing steps are done using statistical operations like Lemmatization & POS tagging.                                     |
| **Data Visualisation**        | 10           | The learner has done the visualisation steps for finding the word count distribution & n-gram distribution.                                                                |
| **Feature Extraction**        | 5            | Features are extracted from the data using Tf-Idf.                                                                                                                          |
| **Topic Modelling**           | 25           | The learner has used Topic Modelling to do the following: <br> - Set the best number of clusters to 5. <br> - Apply the best number to create word clusters. <br> - Inspect & validate the correction of each cluster for each complaint. <br> - Map the clusters to topics/cluster names. |
| **Model Building**            | 20           | Prepared the train & test data using the labels received from NMF. The learner has to apply at least 2 of these models on the dataset created: <br> - Logistic regression <br> - Decision Tree <br> - Random Forest <br> - Naive Bayes (optional) <br> Once the models are built, the learner has to evaluate their performance using relevant evaluation metrics to select the best model. |
| **Model Inference**           | 5            | The learner has applied the best model to predict a custom text to see its performance.                                             |
| **Code readability and conciseness** | 10           | The learner has done the following: <br> - Appropriate comments are written wherever applicable. <br> - Overall, the code is readable and has appropriate indentations.    |
